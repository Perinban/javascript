//Prototypes
//Prototypes is an object that exists on every function in Javascript

function myFunction(){

//To view the Object prototype,

console.log(person38.__proto__); //Returns {} it is an empty object

//Object Prototype and function prototype are used differently

//Function Prototype
//A function prototype is an object instance that will become the prototype for all objects created using a function as a constructor

//Object Prototype
//An object prototype is the Object instance from which the object is inherited

//Its either function or object prototype -> Both were just a instance of an object in memory

//When a function is created, a new prototype object is created in memory an attached to function behind the scenes
//If that function is then used a constructor function with the new keyword, the new object that is created has a proto property that is pointing to the same object in memory
//That is called function prototype

//Person constructor function

//Change the prototype property

console.log(Person1); //This will return same Person1 function

console.log(sam); //This will return the instance of the Person1 
//Person1 { firstName: "Sam", lastName: "Billings", age: 29}

console.log(Person1.prototype); //Prototype age is being add here
//Returns Person1 { age:29 }

console.log(sam.__proto__); //this also returns the same
//Returns Person1 { age:29 }

let clinton = new Person1("William", "Clinton"); //Creation of new instance of Object Person1

console.log(clinton);

console.log(Person1.prototype);

console.log(clinton.__proto__); //Returns the same 
//Returns Person1 { age:29 }

//If I try  to change anything

clinton.__proto__.age = 20;

//Changed age will be reflected in all. Since all were stored in the same memory
console.log(sam.__proto__); //Returns Person1 { age: 20 }

console.log(clinton.__proto__); //Returns Person1 { age: 20 }

console.log(Person1.prototype); //Returns Person1 { age: 20 }

//Object instance that is a function prototype becomes the prototype of all the objects created from that prototype
//So adding a property to a function's prototype affects all the Objects that are constructed using that function

//Here, If i change Person1.prototype.age it changes for all
//If any constructor prototype age is changed, it changes for all
//But if we change all for single Object instead of prototype,

sam.age = 40;

console.log(sam.age); //Returns 40
console.log(clinton.age); //Returns 20 - Here it is not affected

//Here what is happening is we are not changing the prototype age property, instead adding a new property to sam. So, clinton.age were not affected
//But still sam have access to both prototype as well

console.log(sam.age); //Returns 40
console.log(sam.__proto__.age); //Returns 20

console.log(Object.keys(sam)); //Returns firstName, lastName and age

delete sam.age; //Delete the age property

console.log(sam.age); //It takes the value from prototype and returns 20
//Javascript checks the value for the property, if it does not find it. it just checks for the prototype whether it has the value or not. If it has, it just returns it.

console.log(sam.hasOwnProperty('age')); //Returns false. Since it does not have age property. It just gets value from Prototype

//Whatever the above scenarios properties do, it can do on functions and Objects or methods as well

//Basically instance property overides the prototype properties

//Change function prototype to a new object

function Person2(firstName,lastName){
    this.firstName = firstName,
    this.lastName = lastName
}

Person2.prototype.age = 18;

//Change function prototype to a new object

console.log(lia.age); //Returns 18 since we are completely changing the object

let chris = new Person2("Chris", "Woakes");

console.log(chris.age); //Returns 30. The new Objects which gets created after the complete change of prototype attains the new value

console.log(Person2.prototype); //Returns {age: 30}

console.log(lia.age); //Returns 18 but still lia holds the old prototype value

//When we point out to a new object, a new instance will be created. Totally now it has 2 instances

console.log(lia.__proto__); //Returns Person2 { age:18 }

console.log(sam2.__proto__); //Returns Person2 { age: 18 }

console.log(chris.__proto__); //Returns { age:30 } -> Here Person2 object is not showing only it returns the newly created object which we pointed to a different storage memory

//Above Objects have multiple layers of inheritance

console.log(chris.__proto__.__proto__); //Returns empty object

console.log(sam2.__proto__.__proto__); //Returns empty object

console.log(chris.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); //Returns null
//Basically sam2 have a Person2 Object instance prototype and inturn Person2 have Object prototype. Like that inheritance goes on.
//This Object prototype was created from Object constructor
//The last prototype chain value was null basically which means Object constructor has no prototype
//NULL indicates the end of the chain
